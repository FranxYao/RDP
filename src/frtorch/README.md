# Fast Research Pytorch

The goal of this library is to let users only need to code for 
* Model 
* Data

But do not need to write code for 
* Training, Validation, Testing
* Saving, Logging

Thus maximumly reduce engineering code, and so users can only focus on research
and data science (hopefully)
